what is done:

took the existing desktop-only todo page and identified fixed-width parts (input and table).
added a media query for screens under 768 px.
made the form stack vertically and stretch input and buttons to full width.
made the table 100% width with smaller padding and font size.
ensured no horizontal scroll or overflow on phones.

what is learnt:

writing css media queries for responsiveness.
adjusting layouts for smaller devices.
testing responsive pages using browser dev tools.
